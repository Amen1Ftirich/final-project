            The Soviet Union, officially the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics
            (USSR), was a transcontinental country that spanned much of Eurasia
            from 1922 to 1991. <br />
            A flagship communist state, it was nominally a federal union of
            fifteen national republics; in practice, both its government and its
            economy were highly centralized until its final years. <br />
            It was a one-party state governed by the Communist Party of the
            Soviet Union, with the city of Moscow serving as its capital within
            its largest and most populous republic: the Russian SFSR. <br />
            Other major cities included Leningrad (Russian SFSR), Kiev
            (Ukrainian SSR), Minsk (Byelorussian SSR), Tashkent (Uzbek SSR),
            Alma-Ata (Kazakh SSR), and Novosibirsk (Russian SFSR). <br />
            It was the largest country in the world, covering over 22,402,200
            square kilometres (8,649,500 sq mi) and spanning eleven time zones.

            The Polish People's Republic (Polish: Polska Rzeczpospolita Ludowa,
            PRL) was a country in Central Europe that existed from 1947 to 1989
            as the predecessor of the modern Republic of Poland. <br />
            With a population of approximately 37.9 million near the end of its
            existence, it was the second most-populous communist and Eastern
            Bloc country in Europe. <br />
            It was also one of the main signatories of the Warsaw Pact alliance.
            The largest city and official capital since 1947 was Warsaw,
            followed by the industrial city of Łódź and cultural city of Kraków.
            <br />
            The country was bordered by the Baltic Sea to the north, the Soviet
            Union to the east, Czechoslovakia to the south, and East Germany to
            the west.

            East Germany, officially the German Democratic Republic (GDR;
            German: Deutsche Demokratische Republik, DDR, was a state that
            existed from 1949 to 1990 in east Germany as part of the Eastern
            Bloc in the Cold War. <br />
            Commonly described as a communist state, it described itself as a
            socialist "workers' and peasants' state". <br />
            Its territory was administered and occupied by Soviet forces
            following the end of World War II—the Soviet occupation zone of the
            Potsdam Agreement, bounded on the east by the Oder-Neisse line.
            <br />
            The Soviet zone surrounded West Berlin but did not include it and
            West Berlin remained outside the jurisdiction of the GDR. <br />
            Most scholars and academics describe the GDR as a totalitarian
            dictatorship.

            The Hungarian People's Republic (Hungarian: Magyar Népköztársaság)
            was a one-party socialist state from 20 August 1949 to 23 October
            1989. <br />
            It was governed by the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, which was
            under the influence of the Soviet Union. <br />
            Pursuant to the 1944 Moscow Conference, Winston Churchill and Joseph
            Stalin had agreed that after the war Hungary was to be included in
            the Soviet sphere of influence. <br />
            The HPR remained in existence until 1989, when opposition forces
            brought the end of communism in Hungary.
